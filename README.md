Instruction:

At the beginning, after the first deal, one of the randomly picked cards from the computer will be shown to the player.
The two cards the player get will be printed to the screen.
The player, as indicated by the prompted instruction, will need to indicate whether to stand or not.
If the player choose to get another card, and if the total score exceeds 21, the game ends automatically. The player loses.
If the player stands (and does it successfully), the a new round of dealing will start with the computer player.
The player doesn't have to type in anything since then.
If at a point the computer's score exceeds 21, the game ends. The player wins.
If the computer stands, both players' score will be printed and the comparison will be made.
Then the winner will be given.
Game ends here.
